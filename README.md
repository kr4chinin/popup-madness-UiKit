# Pop-up Madness experimental UiKit ðŸ“§

## Introduction

This application contains not only custom **pop-up / pop-over UiKit** but also a small social net mockup to test it and take a look on its functionality. This kit may be a nice **foundation** for more complex ones, here I've implemented: 

* Dialog pop-up
* Fullscreen pop-up
* Overlaying pop-up
* Pop-over component
* Portal component
* Some **helper components** and **hooks**

![Brief functionality](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103210607/187419160-c3162869-253c-449f-b85c-66a8053b5b90.gif)

### Functionality

* ```<Portal />``` is the main building component for all the pop-ups. All portals are appended one after another to the special ```<div />``` with  ```id="portals"``` which is created at the very beginning. This allows to show the last opened pop-up on the screen without caring too much about z-indexes, and to close them one by one.

* ```<OverlayingPopup />``` is a frame for all the pop-ups which have **dark overlay**. It has nice animations and box for content:

* ```<Dialog />``` it's a variety of ```<OverlayingPopup />``` but it has one or two buttons, it can be used for interactions with user like a **system dialog window**:

* ```<FullscreenPopup />``` is a template for pop-ups which have size of the whole screen:

* ```<Popover />``` can be used when you need to place one pop-up inside another one withour any overlays and difficulties. Also, [Popper](https://popper.js.org) library was used here:

Using this **structural elements** in this application I've also implemented:

1. Dark / light themes

2. Ability to change user information using pop-ups / pop-overs, and **smooth animations**
3. **Custom hooks** such as ```useClickOutside``` to track whether user clicks outside of pop-over's body and close it
4. Ability to close pop-ups one by one by pressing *Escape* (```<EscapeListener />``` component)
